# Python Foundation

Welcome to the Python Foundation Course! This course is designed to give you a solid understanding of Python programming from the ground up. We will focus on writing clean, testable code and follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) using pytest throughout the course.

## Course Outline
### Chapter 1 : Hello Python
This chapter introduces the Python development workflow. You will learn how to set up your environment, write and run Python programs, create tests with pytest, and debug code in VS Code.<br/>

[Learn Chapter 1](Chapter01/README.md)

### Chapter 2 : Variable and Basic Data Types 
In this chapter, we will explore one of the fundamental concepts in Python: variables and basic data types. Variables are used to store data that your program can manipulate, while data types define the kind of values a variable can hold, such as numbers, text, or logical values.<br/>

[Learn Chapter 2](Chapter02/README.md)

### Chapter 3 : Writing Statements
Control flow: conditionals, loops, and branching statements.<br/>
[Learn Chapter 3](Chapter03/README.md)

### Chapter 4 : Functions 
Defining functions, passing arguments, return values, and TDD for functions.

### Chapter 5 : Classes and Objects
Introduction to object-oriented programming in Python.

### Chapter 6 : Modules and Packages
Organizing code into reusable modules and packages.

### Chapter 7 : Exception Handling
Managing errors and writing robust code. 

### Chapter 8 : Inputs & Outputs
Reading from and writing to files and the console.

### Chapter 9 : Data Structures
Working with lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, and understanding their uses.

## Approach
In this course, we will adopt a Test-Driven Development approach:

- Write a test first to define expected behavior.
- Implement the functionality to pass the test.
- Refactor the code while keeping the test green.

Using pytest, you will learn how to write automated tests and ensure your code works as intended from day one. This approach helps you build reliable, maintainable, and high-quality Python code.
