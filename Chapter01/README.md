# Chapter 1 : Hello Python

This chapter introduces the Python development workflow. You will learn how to set up your environment, write and run Python programs, create tests with pytest, and debug code in VS Code.

## ðŸŽ¯ Target of this chapter
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Set up a Python development environment
- Understand how Python works and executes code
- Create and organize a Python project in VS Code
- Write and run basic Python programs
- Write test cases using pytest
- Execute and manage test cases effectively
- Debug Python code within VS Code

## ðŸ§­ Learning Path

In this chapter, you will take hands-on steps to set up Python and experience the real coding workflow:

- Check Requirements â€“ Ensure your computer has everything needed for Python development
- Install Python and VS Code â€“ Set up your coding environment
- Create a Virtual Environment â€“ Keep your project isolated and clean
- Install Pytest â€“ Get ready to test your code
- Write a Function Stub â€“ Start with a simple function placeholder
- Write Your First Test Case â€“ Define the expected result using pytest
- Run the Test Case (and See It Fail) â€“ Understand how TDD works by failing first
- Refactor the Function â€“ Fix your code until the test passes
- Debug and Run Again â€“ Learn how to catch errors and confirm success

### Check Requirements
Before you start coding in Python, make sure your system meets the minimum requirements:
- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Python Version: Python 3.10 or higher (latest stable recommended)
- Disk Space: At least 500 MB free for Python and project files
- Memory (RAM): Minimum 4 GB, recommended 8 GB for smoother performance
- Internet Connection: Required for downloading Python, VS Code, and packages
- Text Editor / IDE: We will use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) in this course

### Install Python and VS Code
### Create Virtual Environment
### Install Pytest
### Write a function stub
### Write your first test case
### Run the test case (and see it fail)
### Refactor the function
### Debug and Run again
