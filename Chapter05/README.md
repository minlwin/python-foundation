# Chapter 5 : Class & Object

**What is a Class?**

- A class is like a blueprint or template.
- It describes how objects of that type should look and behave.
- Example analogy: A blueprint of a car (class) vs. an actual car (object).

**What is an Object?**

- An object is an instance of a class.
- Each object has its own data (attributes) and can perform actions (methods).
- Example:
    - Car â†’ class
    - my_car = Car("red", "Toyota") â†’ object

**Why Do We Need Classes and Objects?**

- They help us organize code in a structured way.
- They allow us to model real-world problems in programming.
- They support reusability and scalability as programs grow larger.
- They are the foundation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), one of the most widely used paradigms.

**What You Will Learn in This Chapter**

1. How to define a class in Python.
2. How to create and use objects.
3. What we can define inside a class:
    - Attributes and Methods
    - Special methods like constructors (__init__).
4. The four basic OOP concepts:
    - Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction.
5. How to write simple programs that use classes and objects effectively.

ðŸ’¡ This chapter is the first step into Object-Oriented Programming. Once you understand classes and objects, youâ€™ll be ready to build more complex and realistic programs.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

1. Explain what classes and objects are, and why they are important in Python.
2. Define a class and create objects (instances) from it.
3. Identify and use the components of a class:
	- Attributes (instance variables, class variables)
	- Methods (instance methods, class methods, static methods)
	- Special methods (__init__, __str__, etc.)
4. Apply the four basic OOP concepts in Python:
	- Encapsulation
	- Inheritance
	- Polymorphism
	- Abstraction
5. Write simple programs using classes and objects to model real-world problems.
